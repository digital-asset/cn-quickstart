# Custom-Generated DAR Files

<<<<<<< HEAD
The DAR files located in this folder are **custom-generated** from the **Canton Network Project** to match the current 
SDK version. These files ensure compatibility with our system until the SDK versions align with the **Canton Network Project**.

## Future Transition
Once both SDK versions match, these DAR files will be sourced directly from the Canton Network Project, and this folder will no longer contain custom-generated versions.

## Important Notes
