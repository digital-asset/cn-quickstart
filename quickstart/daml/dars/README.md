# Custom-Generated DAR Files

The DAR files located in this folder are from the **Canton Network Project** to match the current 
SDK version. These files ensure compatibility with our system until the SDK versions align with the **Canton Network Project**.

## Important Notes
- These DAR files are temporary and will be deprecated once the official versions are compatible.
- Ensure that you track SDK version updates to transition seamlessly.
- For further details on the Canton Network Project, refer to the official documentation or project repository.

If you have any questions or require assistance, please contact the development team.
