Project structure overview
==========================

When approaching the Canton Network Quickstart it is important to keep in
mind that Quickstart is not a "framework" or "platform". Rather, it is a 
snapshot of an early-stage Canton Network project that has spent several
sprints developing developer, test, and deployment infrastructure and is
just beginning to transition to feature delivery.

Developer infrastructure and project logistics are more transferable between
projects than specific feature delivery.  The goal of Canton Network
Quickstart is to act as a "bootstrap scaffold", to provide the benefits of
early investment in such project infrastructure to every Canton Network
Application development team on the network.

As a guide to Quickstart, the treatment of supporting topics is
necessarily shallow. In addition to the online documentation [1]_,
Digital Asset provides a number of free courses [2]_ covering the Daml
Language, the Canton Ledger, and architectural considerations. In
particular the Technical Solution Architect path [3]_ provides a lot of
useful background to this guide.
