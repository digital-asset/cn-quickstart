Project overview
================

The Canton Network (CN) Quickstart is not a "framework" or "platform". 
It is a snapshot of a CN project that has spent several sprints creating developer, test, and deployment infrastructure and is transitioning to feature delivery.

Developer infrastructure and project logistics are more transferable between projects than specific feature delivery. 
The goal of CN Quickstart is to act as a "bootstrap scaffold", 
to provide the benefits of early investment in such project infrastructure to every CN Application development team on the network.

As a guide to Quickstart, the treatment of supporting topics is necessarily shallow.
In addition to the online documentation [1]_,
Digital Asset provides a number of free courses [2]_ covering the Daml
Language, the Canton Ledger, and architectural considerations. 
In particular the Technical Solution Architect path [3]_ provides a lot of
useful background to this guide.
