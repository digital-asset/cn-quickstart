Project structure overview
==========================

The Quickstart application supports development efforts to build, test, and deploy CN applications.
It resolves infrastructure problems that every CN application must solve.
Use the CN Quickstart application so you can focus on building your application.

If you need support beyond the scope of this and other Quickstart guides, 
consider the online `Daml documentation <https://docs.daml.com/>`__ and `free courses <https://www.digitalasset.com/training-and-certification>`__ covering the Daml Language, the Canton Ledger, and architectural considerations. 
In particular, the `Technical Solution Architect path <https://daml.talentlms.com/catalog/info/id:160>`__ provides useful background to this guide.
