Project overview
================

The Canton Network (CN) Quickstart is scaffolding to support development efforts to build, test, and deploy CN applications.

We've resolved the infrastructure problems that every CN application must solve.
Use the CN Quickstart Application so you and your team can focus on building your application, instead of build systems, deployment configurations, and testing infrastructure.

If you need support beyond the scope of this and other Quickstart guides, 
consider the online `Daml documentation <https://docs.daml.com/>`__ and `free courses <https://www.digitalasset.com/training-and-certification>`__ covering the Daml Language, the Canton Ledger, and architectural considerations. 
In particular the `Technical Solution Architect path <https://daml.talentlms.com/catalog/info/id:160>`__ provides useful background to this guide.
