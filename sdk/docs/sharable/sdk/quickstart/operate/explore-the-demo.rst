Business case
=============

The Canton Network (CN) Quickstart is scaffolding to support development efforts to build, test, and deploy CN applications.
It resolves infrastructure problems that every CN application must solve.
Use the CN Quickstart Application so you and your team can focus on building your application, instead of build systems, deployment configurations, and testing infrastructure.

Core business operations
------------------------

The Quickstart features a sample licensing app to demonstrate Canton development patterns. 
In the app, providers sell time-based access to their services.
Users pay with Canton Coin (CC) and manage payments through a Canton Wallet. 

The app involves four parties:

- The **Application Provider** who sells licenses.
- The **Application User** who buys licenses.
- The underlying **Amulet** token system that handles payments, using `Canton Coin <https://www.canton.network/blog/canton-coin-a-canton-network-native-payment-application>`__.
- The **DSO Party**, the Decentralized Synchronizer Operations Party who operates the Amulet payment system. In CN, this is the Super Validators.

The application issues licenses using the following process:

Issuing a license
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The provider creates a new license for an onboarded user. 
The license starts expired and needs to be renewed before use.

Requesting a license renewal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The provider creates a renewal request, generating a payment request for the user.
A matching CC payment request is created on the ledger.

Paying for a license renewal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user approves the payment through their Canton Wallet, which creates an accepted payment contract on the ledger.

Renewing the license
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The provider processes the accepted payment and updates the license with a new expiration date.

Overview
========

This How-to helps you become familiar with a Canton Network (CN) business operation within the CN App Quickstart.
The App Quickstart application is intended to be extended by your team to meet your business needs.
When you are familiar with the App Quickstart, review the technology choices and application design to determine what changes are needed.
Technology and design decisions are ultimately up to you.

If you find errors, please contact your representative at Digital Asset.

Prerequisites
=============

Install the `CN App Quickstart <../download/cnqs-installation.html>`__ before beginning this demonstration.

`Contact us <https://www.digitalasset.com/contact-us?comments=I%27m%20requesting%20access%20to%20jFrog>`__ if you need support accessing JFrog Artifactory.

Walkthrough
===========

The CN App Quickstart can run with or without authorization, based on your business needs.
Toggle authorization with the ``make setup`` command in the ``quickstart`` subdirectory.
``make setup`` asks to enable Observability, OAUTH2, and specify a party hint.
In this demo, we disable ``TEST MODE``, use the default party hint, and show OAUTH2 as enabled and disabled.
When OAUTH2 makes a difference, we display both paths, one after the other. 
You can follow your path and ignore the other.
You may enable Observability, but it is not required for this demo.

**Choose your adventure:**

``make setup`` **without** OAUTH2:

   :alt: Make setup no auth

``make setup`` **with** OAUTH2:

.. image:: images/make-setup-with-oauth.png
   :alt: Make setup with auth

Build Quickstart
----------------

Build and start App Quickstart:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   make build; make start

Open an incognito browser and navigate to:

::

   app-provider.localhost:3000

Alternatively, in the terminal, from quickstart/ run:

::

  ``make open-app-ui``

Login
-----

**OAUTH2 disabled**

When OAUTH2 is **disabled**, the homepage presents a simple login field.
Begin by logging in as the ``AppProvider`` by entering "app-provider" in the User field.

.. image:: images/01-login-app-qs-noauth.png
   :alt: CN App Quickstart Login screen without Auth
   :width: 60%

**OAUTH2 enabled**

When OAUTH2 is **enabled**, the homepage prompts to login with Keycloak's OAuth 2.0 portal:

.. image:: images/01-login-app-qs-auth.png
   :alt: CN App Quickstart Login screen with Auth
   :width: 60%

Make a mental note that ``AppProvider``’s username is “app-provider” and the password is "abc123" (all lowercase).

Login with ``app-provider`` with keycloak.

Fill in the login credentials: username: app-provider, password: abc123

.. image:: images/login-app-provider-view.png

The App Installs Menu
---------------------

Once you are logged in select **AppInstalls** in the menu.

.. image:: images/qs-demo-app-installs-view.png
   :alt: App Installs view

Open a terminal to create an app install request.

From ``/quickstart/`` run:

::

  ``make create-app-install-request``

This command creates an App Installation Request on behalf of the Participant.

.. image:: images/04-create-install-req.png
   :alt: App Install Request

.. note:: If your machine is not powerful enough to host ``LocalNet`` or if the docker containers are not responsive then the response may show a failure with status code 404 or 000 (as shown in the image below). Increasing Docker memory limit to at least 8 GB should allow the ``LocalNet`` containers to operate properly.

.. image:: images/05-error-app-install.png
   :alt: App Install Request error

Return to the browser.

AppInstallRequest
-----------------

The install request appears in the list.

Click **Accept**.

.. image:: images/accept-awaiting-request.png
   :alt: accept request

The ``AppInstallRequest`` is Accepted. 

.. image:: images/success-accepted-appinstallrequest.png
   :alt: accepted request
   :width: 60%

The actions update to Cancel and Create license.

Create a license
----------------

Click **Create License**.
The license is created and the “# Licenses” field is updated.

.. image:: images/created-license.png
   :alt: create license

Next, navigate to the Licenses menu and select **Renewals**.

.. image:: images/new-license-select-renewals.png
   :alt: Licenses view

.. image:: images/renew-license-modal.png
   :alt: renew license modal

In the modal, set the number of days to renew the license, the fee, time to prepare the license, and time to settle the license.
You must add a description to proceed.

"Prepare in" is an indication for the sender (app-user) that they are expected to accept allocation before that time.
"Settle in" is a time that the provider has to `completeRenewal`. 
After that, the allocation will be expired.

Click **Issue License Renewal Request**.

.. image:: images/new-license-renewal-request.png
   :alt: new license renewal request

Per the Daml contract, licenses are created in an expired state.
To activate the license, a renewal payment request must be issued.

Make a payment
--------------

To make payment, navigate to the Canton Wallet at http://wallet.localhost:2000/allocations and log in as ``app-user`` if prompted.

You can find the wallet's location by: 

1. Reading the `Splice Local Network docs <https://docs.dev.sync.global/app_dev/testing/localnet.html#application-uis>`__.
2. Navigating to the App Provider's "Tenants" menu.

Canton Console
==============

The :externalref:`Canton Console <canton_console>` connects to the running application ledger.
The console allows a developer to bypass the UI to interact with the CN in a more direct manner.
For example, in Canton Console you can connect to the Participant to see the location of the Participant and their synchronizer domain.

Activate the :externalref:`Canton Console <canton_remote_console>` in a terminal from the ``quickstart/`` directory.
Run:

::

  make canton-console

After the console initiates, run the ``participants`` and ``participants.all`` commands, respectively.

::

  participants

Returns a detailed categorization of participants.

.. image:: images/canton-console-participants.png
   :alt: Participant location in the ledger

::

  participants.all

Shows a list of all participant references.

.. image:: images/canton-console-participants-all.png
