Exploring the demo
==================

Explore the demo is intended to help you become familiar with a Canton Network (CN) business operation within the CN App Quickstart.
The App Quickstart application is intended to be incrementally extended by your team to meet your business needs.
When you are familiar with the App Quickstart, review the technology choices and application design to determine what changes are needed.
Technology and design decisions are ultimately up to you.

As a result, the CN App Quickstart guides may be a little out of step with the application.
If you find errors or other inconsistencies, please contact your representative at Digital Asset.

This section works through a complete business operation within the CN App Quickstart.

Prerequisites
=============

You should have successfully `installed the CN App Quickstart <../download/cnqs-installation.html>`__
before beginning this demonstration.

Access to the `CN Docker repository <https://digitalasset.jfrog.io/ui/native/canton-network-docker>`__
is needed to successfully pull the Digital Asset artifacts from JFrog Artifactory.

If you need support accessing the JFrog Artifactory, please email support@digitalasset.com.

The CN App Quickstart is a Dockerized application and requires `Docker Desktop <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/>`__.
It is recommended to allocate 8 GB of memory to properly run the required Docker containers.
If you witness unhealthy containers, please consider allocating additional resources, if possible.

Walkthrough
===========

The CN App Quickstart can run with or without authorization, based on your business needs.
Toggle authorization with the ``make setup`` command in the ``quickstart`` subdirectory.
``make setup`` asks to enable Observability, OAUTH2, and specify a party hint.
In this demo, we use the default party hint, and we show OAUTH2 as enabled and disabled.
When OAUTH2 makes a difference, we display both paths one after the other. 
You can follow your path and ignore the other.
You may enable Observability, but it is not required for this demo.

**Choose your adventure:**

``make setup`` **without** OAUTH2:

   :alt: Make setup no auth

``make setup`` **with** OAUTH2:

.. image:: images/make-setup-with-oauth.png
   :alt: Make setup with auth

Build and start App Quickstart:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   make build; make start

Open an incognito browser.

Navigate to:

::

   app-provider.localhost:3000

Alternatively, in the terminal, from quickstart/ run:

::

  ``make open-app-ui``

**OAUTH2 disabled**

When OAUTH2 is **disabled**, the homepage presents a simple login field.
Begin by logging in as the ``AppProvider`` by entering "app-provider" in the User field.

.. image:: images/01-login-app-qs-noauth.png
   :alt: CN App Quickstart Login screen without Auth

**OAUTH2 enabled**

When OAUTH2 is **enabled**, the homepage prompts to login with Keycloak's OAuth 2.0 portal:

.. image:: images/01-login-app-qs-auth.png
   :alt: CN App Quickstart Login screen with Auth

Make a mental note that ``AppProvider``‚Äôs username is ‚Äúapp-provider‚Äù and the password is "abc123" (all lowercase).

Login with ``app-provider`` with keycloak.

Fill in the login credentials: username: app-provider, password: abc123

.. image:: images/login-app-provider-view.png
   :alt: AppProvider login screen

**The App Installs Menu**

Once you are logged in select ‚ÄúAppInstalls‚Äù in the menu.

.. image:: images/appinstalls-default-view.png
   :alt: App Installs view

Open a terminal to create an app install request.

From ``/quickstart/`` run:

::

  ``make create-app-install-request``

This command creates an App Installation Request on behalf of the Participant.

.. image:: images/04-create-install-req.png
   :alt: App Install Request

.. note:: If your machine is not powerful enough to host ``LocalNet`` or if the docker containers are not responsive then the response may show a failure with status code 404 or 000 (as shown in the image below). Increasing Docker memory limit to at least 8 GB should allow the ``LocalNet`` containers to operate properly.

.. image:: images/05-error-app-install.png
   :alt: App Install Request error

Return to the browser.

The install request appears in the list.

Click ‚ÄúAccept‚Äù.

.. image:: images/app-installs-new-install-request.png
   :alt: install request

The ``AppInstallRequest`` is Accepted. 
The actions update to create or cancel the license.

Click ‚ÄúCreate License‚Äù.

.. image:: images/accept-app-install-request.png
   :alt: accept request

The license is created and the ‚Äú# Licenses‚Äù field is updated.

.. image:: images/create-license-success.png
   :alt: create license

Next, navigate to the "Licenses" menu and select ‚ÄúActions.‚Äù

.. image:: images/licenses-view.png
   :alt: Licenses view

An ‚ÄúActions for License‚Äù modal opens with an option to renew or expire the license.
Per the Daml contract, licenses are created in an expired state.
To activate the license, a renewal payment request must be issued.
Enter a description for the license renewal request, then click the green ‚ÄúIssue Renewal Payment Request‚Äù button.

.. image:: images/activate-license-modal.png
   :alt: issue renewal

The license renewal process is initiated and a 30-day extension becomes available for a fee of $100 CC.

.. image:: images/license-renewal-request-success.png
   :alt: license available

The app-provider has done as much as they are able until the app-user pays the renewal fee.

   üí°For the next step we recommend opening a separate browser in incognito mode.
   Each user should be logged into separate browsers for most consistent results.
   For example, if you logged into ``AppProvider`` using Chrome, you would use Firefox when logging into ``AppUser``.

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ using a separate browser in incognito or private mode.

Your login screen will look as it had when you logged in as ``AppProvider``.

**OAUTH2 disabled**

If OAUTH2 is disabled, simply log in as ``app-user``.

.. image:: images/login-app-user-noauth.png
   :alt: AppUser login screen without Auth

**OAUTH2 enabled**

When OAUTH2 is enabled, you log in using the app-user username and password.

.. image:: images/01-login-app-qs-auth.png
   :alt: login screen

Login as ``AppUser`` with ‚Äúapp-user" as the username and the password is ‚Äúabc123‚Äù.

.. image:: images/appuser-auth-login-view.png
   :alt: AppUser login screen

**The App User Licenses Menu**

As the app-user, go to the **Licenses** view and click the ‚ÄúPay renewal‚Äù button.

.. image:: images/appuser-licenses-view.png
   :alt: License view

**OAUTH2 disabled**

When OAUTH2 is disabled, you are directed to log in to the Canton Wallet, directly.
Use "app-user" as the username.

.. image:: images/appuser-canton-coin-wallet-login-noauth.png
   :alt: AppUser Canton Coin no auth

**OAUTH2 enabled**

When OAUTH2 is enabled, you log in to the Canton Coin Wallet by clicking ‚ÄúLOG IN WITH OAUTH2‚Äù.

.. image:: images/16-cc-wallet-login.png
   :alt: CC Wallet login

This navigates to a keycloak login.

Enter the app-user username and password.

.. image:: images/app-user-reauth.png
   :alt: appuser reauth login
   :width: 60%

**Canton Coin Wallet**

Signing in navigates to a preloaded Canton Coin Wallet.
Click **Send Payment**.

.. image:: images/cc-wallet-send-payment.png
   :alt: CC Wallet view

Return to the ``AppProvider``‚Äôs License Renewal Requests View.
The ``AppProvider`` may now Complete the Renewal.

.. image:: images/app-provider-complete-renewal.png
   :alt: complete renewal

Clicking ‚ÄúComplete Renewal‚Äù results in a Success.

.. image:: images/renew-license-success.png
   :alt: renewal success

The App User's License view shows the activated license.

   :alt: Activated license

Congratulations. You‚Äôve successfully created and activated a license with a payment transfer!

Canton Console
--------------

The :externalref:`Canton Console <canton_console>` connects to the running application ledger.
The console allows a developer to bypass the UI to interact with the CN in a more direct manner.
For example, in Canton Console you can connect to the Participant to see the location of the Participant and their synchronizer domain.

Activate the :externalref:`Canton Console <canton_remote_console>` in a terminal from the ``quickstart/`` directory.
Run:

::

  make canton-console

After the console initiates, run the ``participants`` and ``participants.all`` commands, respectively.

::

  participants

Returns a detailed categorization of participants.

.. image:: images/canton-console-participants.png
   :alt: Participant location in the ledger

::

  participants.all

Shows a list of all participant references.

.. image:: images/canton-console-participants.all.png
   :alt: Participant synchronizer

::

  health.status

Is a diagnostic tool that displays the health of Canton Network participants.

Daml Shell
----------

The :externalref:`Daml Shell <build_daml_shell_component_howto>` connects to the running PQS database of the application provider‚Äôs Participant.
In the Shell, the assets and their details are available in real time.

Run the shell from quickstart/ in the terminal with:

::

  make shell

Run the following commands to see the data:
